## The PRINCIPLE of Prof. NOTA

### Play • Learn • Work

**We choose to remain as children.** Because from there comes the courage to try, the joy of falling and rising again, and the boundless imagination to see the world.  

Children are often reckless, careless, clumsy, and bold. Brave not because they already know, but because they do not know yet—  
and they step forward to find out.  

#### Play

Play is how we open the door. Everything new begins with curiosity. In play, there is no right or wrong — only experiments that lead to discoveries.  

Sometimes play means being reckless, sometimes careless, even foolish. But through these moments, we experience what can never be learned from books. If we have not yet felt the pain, we have not yet learned the lesson.  

#### Learn

Learning is the breath of every step. We never stop learning. Every mistake is a teacher, every failure is fuel. To know because we have experienced, to understand because we once fell — this is the kind of wisdom that grows from the ground up.  

Learning makes play meaningful, and makes work no longer a burden.  

#### Work

Work is the longer game. Not just routine, but the continuation of play and learning. We work to bring imagination into form,  
to turn what is only possible into something real.  

And in work, too, we carry that same recklessness and bravery of children — not blind courage, but courage that transforms ignorance into wisdom.

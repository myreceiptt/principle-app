Please include:

## ⏳ What Happens Next?

- You’ll receive a confirmation reply within **3 working days**.
- We aim to validate and patch any valid issues within **7–14 days** depending on severity.
- Critical issues may trigger immediate `hotfix` patches, while non-critical ones are included in the next scheduled release.
- If the vulnerability is valid, you will be **credited (unless anonymity is requested)**.
